- [ ] Function logic tested manually

## Deployment Checklist

### Step 1: Environment Setup
- [ ] Supabase CLI installed
  ```bash
  npm install -g supabase
  ```
- [ ] Logged into Supabase
  ```bash
  supabase login
  ```
- [ ] Project linked
  ```bash
  supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
  ```

### Step 2: Environment Variables
- [ ] Get Supabase URL from Dashboard
  - Settings > API > Project URL
- [ ] Get Service Role Key from Dashboard
  - Settings > API > service_role (secret key - not anon!)
- [ ] Set environment variables
  ```bash
  supabase secrets set SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co
  supabase secrets set SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbG...
  ```
- [ ] Verify secrets are set
  ```bash
  supabase secrets list
  ```

### Step 3: Deploy Function
- [ ] Navigate to function directory
  ```bash
  cd D:\develop\pratorinaldo-next\supabase\functions\cleanup-sessions
  ```
- [ ] Run deploy script
  ```bash
  ./deploy.sh
  ```
  Or manually:
  ```bash
  supabase functions deploy cleanup-sessions
  ```
- [ ] Verify deployment
  ```bash
  supabase functions list
  ```

### Step 4: Configure Cron (Already Done)
- [x] Cron configuration added to `supabase/config.toml`
- [ ] Verify cron is active in Supabase Dashboard
  - Edge Functions > cleanup-sessions > Cron Triggers
  - Should show: `0 2 * * *` (Daily at 2 AM UTC)

### Step 5: Testing
- [ ] Test with dry run (safe)
  ```bash
  curl -X POST 'https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/cleanup-sessions?dry_run=true' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY"
  ```
- [ ] Verify response is successful
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "stats": { ... },
    "message": "Dry run completed - no data was deleted"
  }
  ```
- [ ] Check function logs
  ```bash
  supabase functions logs cleanup-sessions --tail 50
  ```
- [ ] Review logged inactive users (if any)
- [ ] Review temp files to be deleted (if any)
- [ ] Review event RSVPs to be deleted (if any)
- [ ] Review moderation items to be deleted (if any)

### Step 6: First Production Run
- [ ] Backup database (recommended)
  ```bash
  # Via Supabase Dashboard: Database > Backups > Create Backup
  ```
- [ ] Review dry run results one more time
- [ ] Execute first cleanup
  ```bash
  curl -X POST 'https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/cleanup-sessions?force=true' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY"
  ```
- [ ] Monitor logs in real-time
  ```bash
  supabase functions logs cleanup-sessions --follow
  ```
- [ ] Verify cleanup statistics
  - Check response JSON for counts
  - Verify no critical errors
- [ ] Spot-check database
  - Temp files deleted?
  - Event RSVPs cleaned?
  - Moderation queue cleaned?

## Post-Deployment Checklist

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Set up log monitoring
  - Option 1: Daily manual check of logs
  - Option 2: Set up log aggregation (Datadog, Sentry, etc.)
  - Option 3: Email notifications on errors
- [ ] Create dashboard widget (optional)
  - Show cleanup statistics
  - Display last run time
  - Show error count
- [ ] Set up alerts (recommended)
  - Function execution failures
  - Errors in response
  - Duration exceeds threshold (e.g., >2 minutes)

### Documentation
- [ ] Update team wiki/docs with deployment info
- [ ] Share QUICK_REFERENCE.md with team
- [ ] Document environment variables in team password manager
- [ ] Add function to monitoring dashboard

### Maintenance Plan
- [ ] Schedule monthly review of cleanup statistics
- [ ] Plan retention period adjustments (if needed)
- [ ] Schedule quarterly review of inactive users for deletion
- [ ] Document any custom changes to CONFIG

## Verification Tests

### Functional Tests
- [ ] Function responds to requests
- [ ] Dry run mode works (no deletions)
- [ ] Force mode works (actual deletions)
- [ ] CORS headers present
- [ ] Response format is correct
- [ ] Statistics are accurate

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Function completes within timeout (10 min)
- [ ] Batch processing prevents memory issues
- [ ] Large datasets handled correctly
- [ ] Duration is reasonable (<2 min for normal loads)

### Error Handling Tests
- [ ] Missing environment variables handled
- [ ] Database errors don't crash function
- [ ] Storage errors don't crash function
- [ ] Partial failures logged but continue
- [ ] Invalid parameters handled gracefully

### Security Tests
- [ ] Service role key works
- [ ] Function has appropriate permissions
- [ ] No sensitive data logged
- [ ] Audit trail created

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

### Immediate Actions
1. [ ] Disable cron trigger
   ```bash
   # Via Dashboard: Edge Functions > cleanup-sessions > Disable Cron
   ```
2. [ ] Check logs for errors
   ```bash
   supabase functions logs cleanup-sessions --tail 200
   ```
3. [ ] Identify issue (environment, code, database)

### Recovery Steps
1. [ ] Restore from backup (if data lost)
2. [ ] Fix identified issue
3. [ ] Test with dry_run again
4. [ ] Re-enable cron when ready

### Rollback Options
- **Option 1:** Disable function temporarily
  ```bash
  # Remove cron trigger via Dashboard
  ```
- **Option 2:** Revert to previous version
  ```bash
  git revert <commit>
  supabase functions deploy cleanup-sessions
  ```
- **Option 3:** Delete function entirely
  ```bash
  supabase functions delete cleanup-sessions
  ```
